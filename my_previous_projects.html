    <h1>My previous projects</h1>
    <p>I've had a lot of projects in the past so heres some of my highlights</p>
      <p>In March of 2024 in my 8th grade year i joined the school science fair and my project was an engine that I had designed that ran on compressed air which i ended up winning the engineering award and could have gone to move up furthor to do another science fair @ ODU but ultimately decided not too.
        In December 2023 I was testing rock slings which date back all the way to ancient greek warfare I was testing to see what sling length created the fastest projectile which turned out to be the rock sling that i made to be about 20 feet long when in use and threw the rock at an average speed of about 231 MPH but this is still not fully conclusive because the speed of which the rock is thrown could still also depend on who is using the sling and how heavy the projectile is</p>
