    <h1>My possible future projects</h1>
    <p>I consistently have a stream of ideas for projects I would like to perform so here are some of them.</p>
    <p>currently i can only think of one thats at the front of my mind and that would be a new vacuum cannon because my last one was quite amazing being able to accelerate a ping pong ball to about Mach 2 (2 times the speed of sound for the uneducated) but it unfortunatly broke only after 3 shots i would like to create one that is bigger and better to hopefully accelerate the ping pong ball even faster!</p>
